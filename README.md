# Notebook Project

This is a project carried out at the University of Lund for the course called "*Reproducible and Interactive Data Science using the Jupyter Notebook*". The notebook explains and elaborate upon some of the data analysis carried out in my masters thesis. Read more in the notebook!


## How to run the notebook


Hello there!

To run the notebook you'll have to do the following. 

**1.** If you do not have anaconda, install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). This will also install the Jupyter Notebook for you. Alternatively install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) seperately.

**2.** Clone this repository with git:

``git clone <URL for this repository>``

Alternatively you can also download it from GitHub.

**3.** Navigate to the project folder

**4.** Install the enviroment.yml file with Anaconda. 

In the terminal write:

``conda env create -f environmental.yml``

Alternatively use pip if you did not install Anaconda

``pip install <required packages>``

For required packages see the enviroment.yml file. 

**5.** Activate the new environment with Anaconda like so:

``source activate padesign``

If you have windows exclude the "source"

**6.** Run Jupyter Notebook by writing the following in the terminal

``jupyter notebook``
